# MecanicaSolidosApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.10.

## Project Description

The **MecanicaSolidosApp** is an educational application aimed at studying the subject of Mechanics of Solids. The application has the following features:

- **Textual Content:** Provides detailed explanations of Mechanics of Solids concepts.
- **Exercises Area:** Allows users to practice and test their knowledge of the subject.
- **Video Gallery:** Includes relevant videos that complement the theoretical content and assist in understanding the topics covered.
- **Bibliographic References:** Presents additional sources for study and in-depth exploration.

Currently, all content is mocked in JSON files or directly in HTML. The intention is to integrate the application with an API in the future to retrieve data from a database.

## Development Server

Run `npm run start` to start the development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute end-to-end tests using a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
